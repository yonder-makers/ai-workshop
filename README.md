# Yonder AI Week - Workshop

> In this workshop, you will learn how to use HuggingFace to run AI in your browser and how to integrate your fine-tuned model in your application. The workshop is divided into two chapters. In the first chapter, you will learn how to use pretrained models in a `Next.js` SSR application using `transformers.js` to solve different NLP tasks. In the second chapter, you will learn how to integrate your fine-tuned model in a `Python FastAPI` application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.14 or later
- Python 3.9.6 (`venv` and `pip` are included)

## Chapter I: Running AI in your browser with HuggingFace

### 1. Install client dependencies

> This step is only required if you are running the application for the first time.

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### 2. Running in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Run your first Named Entity Recognition (NER) model

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
- Type a sentence in English in the text area: **_My name is John, I live in Singapore and work at Microsoft._**
- Analyze the the result.
- Try other sentences and see how the model performs.

**_Let's discover together the HuggingFace Platform and then analyze the code_**

### 4. From NER to Fill Mask

- Change the model from NER to Fill Mask (E.g. `Xenova/distilbert-base-cased`):
- Try the same sentence as before: **_My name is John, I live in Singapore and work at Microsoft._** but replace the word **_work_** with **_[MASK]_**.
- Analyze the the result.

**_Everything looks great but how can I customize existing models?_**

## Chapter II: Integrate your fine-tuned model in your application

> Make sure you followed the steps fine-tuning your model
> Make sure that you are using the right Python version (3.9.6)

### 1. Install server dependencies

#### Linux/MacOS

```bash
cd server
/usr/bin/python3 -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Windows

```bash
cd server
python -m venv .env
.env\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Deploy your model

Copy the model directory to `server`

**_Let's analyze the code_**

### 2. Running the server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 3. Viewing your resume sentence classification in the browser

#### Using Swagger UI

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs`. You should see the Swagger UI.
- Open the `POST /` endpoint and click on `Try it out`.
- Choose a file to upload and select your resume (E.g. `resume.pdf`).
- Click on `Execute` and analyze the JSON Response.

#### Using Web UI

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/resume`.
- Upload your resume and analyze the UI result.
